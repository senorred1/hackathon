# Run Pre-Launch Review

Run a comprehensive review of all generated pages and report findings. Fix what you can automatically. For anything that requires human input (e.g., missing GTM ID), report it clearly so the user knows what's still needed.

## Checks to Run

### 1. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Color contrast ratios on all text/background combinations
- Alt text on every image
- Heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3, no skipped levels)
- Keyboard navigation (all interactive elements focusable and operable)
- Form labels and ARIA attributes
- Focus indicators visible

### 2. Images
- **No hotlinked images** — scan all `<img>` src attributes for external URLs. All images must be local in `public/images/`. Flag any external URLs as critical.
- All `<img>` tags have explicit `width` and `height` attributes
- Images use appropriate formats (WebP/AVIF for photos, SVG for icons/logos)
- Images are reasonably sized (not serving 4000px originals at 800px display)
- Hero image uses `loading="eager"` and `fetchpriority="high"`
- All other images use `loading="lazy"`
- Run image compression if any images are oversized

### 3. Responsiveness
- Screenshot or verify layout at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px+)
- No horizontal scroll on any page
- No overlapping elements or cut-off text
- Navigation works on mobile (hamburger menu, etc.)

### 4. Scripts & Launch Readiness
- Check if GTM or GA is installed. If not, report: "GTM/GA not found. Need the GTM container ID or GA measurement ID to install."
- Check the reference site's `<head>` for scripts that should carry over (chat widgets, tracking pixels, remarketing tags, heatmaps). Report any found with: "The reference site has [script]. Do you want this on the new site?"
- Check if BugHerd script is still present. If so, flag: "BugHerd script still installed. Remove before launch."
- Check if `noindex` meta tag is still present. If so, flag: "noindex still set. Remove before launch."

### 5. Functionality
- All navigation links work (no remaining /404 links)
- Forms submit without errors
- Console errors reviewed — fix what's possible, report the rest
- Redirects in `public/_redirects` are present and correctly formatted

### 6. Build
- Run `npm run build` to verify clean build
- Report any build warnings or errors

## Report Format

```
Pre-Launch Review
=================

✅ PASSING
  - [list items that pass]

⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION (can fix automatically)
  - [list items Claude will fix]

❌ NEEDS HUMAN INPUT
  - [list items that require information or decisions from the user]
  - Example: "GTM not installed. Provide your GTM container ID (GTM-XXXXXX) to add it."
  - Example: "Reference site has Intercom chat widget. Should this be added?"

📊 STATS
  - Pages reviewed: [count]
  - Images checked: [count]
  - Issues found: [count] ([count] auto-fixed, [count] need input)
```

After reporting, automatically fix everything in the "NEEDS ATTENTION" category without asking. Only pause for items that need human input.
